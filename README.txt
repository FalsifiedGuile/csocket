Simple demonstration of C socket file transfer for computer using local network. Although the code was tested on only one machine  
its functionality is easily modifiable to demonstrate network data transmission.  
 
Details on implementation is self-explanatory via the comments in the code.  
 
Feel free to use the code as you wish, no crediting is required or even recommended as this code was created with a tight time constraint.  
Henceforth a lack of planning and unpolish algorithm and coding in general. I strongly suggest understanding the concept behind the  
implementation and create a polished version. I or even my partner in this project may update it if it relates to a future project.
